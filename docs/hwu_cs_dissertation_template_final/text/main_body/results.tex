\section{Results}
\label{sec:res}

In the Results chapter of your thesis, present the findings of your research in a clear, factual manner. This section should be free from interpretation, focusing solely on reporting what the data reveals. Organize your results logically, often mirroring the sequence of your methods section. Use tables, graphs, and charts to effectively communicate your data, ensuring each is clearly labeled and explained. This chapter should provide a straightforward account of what you discovered, setting the stage for deeper analysis in the following chapters.

In this section, we will present the result of the work described in \cref{sec:meth}.
