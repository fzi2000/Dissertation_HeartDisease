\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

The Conclusions chapter distinctively encapsulates your dissertation, summarizing key findings and their implications. It revisits your research objectives and questions, highlighting how your work fills the identified gap. This chapter also briefly reiterates the study's limitations and suggests future research directions, focusing more on summarizing the overall contributions and outcomes of your research, as opposed to the detailed examination and implications discussed in the Analysis and Discussion chapters.

This is the conclusion of this dissertation. We re-contextualise the motivation for the project (\cref{sec:concl_motiv}), list our contributions \cref{sec:concl_contrib}, and finally discuss the limitation of the project and suggest future work \cref{sec:concl_limit}.

\subsection{Motivation and Goals}
\label{sec:concl_motiv}

Here we will summarise briefly what were the motivations for the project, and the main objectives we tried to achieve.

\subsection{Contributions}
\label{sec:concl_contrib}

Here we will summarise the main contributions and achievements of this project, in relation to the initial objectives, and in contrast with similar work found in the background chapter (\cref{sec:back}).

We will also summarise the methodologies used to achieve goals and tackle problems.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}
\label{sec:concl_limit}

Here we will highlight the main limitations of the project, and suggest possible corrections, extensions, or uses for our work in future projects.
