\section{Appendix: Project Management}
\label{app:screen}

This chapter presents a detailed examination of the project management approaches used for this research. It begins with an overview of the project management plan, followed by a Gantt chart illustrating the project timeline and concludes with a risk analysis.
This section provides an overview of the project management techniques and planning strategies adopted to ensure the successful completion of this research project, scheduled from September 2024 to May 2025. \\
Effective project management is necessary to structure various phases of the research including model development and documentation within a limited timeframe. The plan is carefully designed to accommodate potential challenges faced during the course of the project. Hence, it enables flexibility throughout the project.

\subsection{Overview of Project Management Approach} \leavevmode
\vspace{-0.2 cm}
\\This research project uses an individual Agile approach, focusing on flexibility, iterative development, and continuous improvement. Agile and Scrum methodologies are used for team-based projects and individual research projects. \\The project is divided into sprints, each with a review phase to evaluate progress and assess challenges. This structured yet flexible management style supports continuous improvement and responsiveness to new findings. Agile methodologies are particularly beneficial in healthcare research, where data complexity and critical outcomes demand a flexible approach. Agile methodologies are being widely used across various industries such as financial services, energy, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and education \cite{zaidi2024review}.

\\ A Gantt Chart is a tool suggested by Agile project management. It is used for tracking the projectâ€™s progress during its timeline. \hyperref[fig:Gantt Chart]{Figure 2} below shows the Gantt chart demonstrating the stages of development of the project. Big tasks have been broken down into smaller sub-tasks for easier implementation. Dependencies between tasks have been added. A buffer period has been allocated to each task to ensure its timely completion.

\subsection{Risk Management}\leavevmode
\\Risk analysis is an important component of project management. It involves identifying potential risks, assessing their impact, and strategically developing techniques to mitigate or eliminate the risks.
Risk management is essential for ensuring project success, especially in sensitive fields like disease prediction in the healthcare sector. 
\\
The following table presents the risk analysis for this project. Each identified risk is assigned a unique risk ID and classified by type, depending on whether it pertains to people, tools, or project requirements. Risks are further categorized based on their likelihood of occurrence and impact on the project, with high, medium, and low priority levels. Additionally, an action type and an action plan have been planned for managing any issues that may arise during the development process. 
\vspace{0.5 cm}
The priority of each risk is colour-coded for the reader's clarity:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textcolor{red}{High Priority risks}}: Risks that need immediate action.
    \item \textbf{\textcolor{orange}{Medium Priority risks}}: Risks that need to be addressed but are less critical than high-priority risks.
    \item \textbf{\textcolor{green}{Low Priority risks}}: Risks that have a lower likelihood of occurrence or impact but should still be monitored.
\end{itemize}
