Cardiovascular diseases affect a huge number of individuals worldwide. Early detection and accurate risk prediction can reduce its impact. Traditional risk factors drive the urgency of developing predictive models that can effectively identify individuals at high risk. \\
This project explores multiple machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, random forests, and deep learning algorithms, to build a robust predictive model for cardiovascular disease. A key innovation in this work is the integration of risk stratification and Explainable AI (XAI) to provide transparency and interpretability in predictions, enabling healthcare professionals to understand the rationale behind model decisions. This is critical for gaining clinical trust and promoting the adoption of AI-driven diagnostic tools in healthcare settings. \\
In addition to model accuracy, this study emphasizes the identification of significant predictors of CVD, optimizing the model for both performance and interpretability. Hence, this project seeks to contribute meaningfully to the field of cardiovascular health, offering insights that could support personalized treatment plans. Through these efforts, this study aims to bridge the gap between complex machine learning models and their practical use in early CVD detection and prevention.
