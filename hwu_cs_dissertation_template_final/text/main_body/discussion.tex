\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

The Discussion chapter is where you explore the meaning and implications of your findings, in contrast to the Analysis chapter that focus on data interpretation. Here, you should connect your results to broader themes and theories in your field, considering the real-world implications and contributions of your work. Discuss how your findings extend, support, or challenge existing knowledge. Reflect on the limitations of your study and propose areas for future research. This chapter is crucial for showcasing your critical thinking and situating your research within the larger academic conversation.

This section provides a discussion of the methodology, results and analysis presented in \cref{sec:meth,sec:res,sec:eval}.

You can cross-examine your findings with items from the literature:
