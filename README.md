# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease based on patient data. The dataset includes attributes such as age, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The project incorporates techniques like feature selection, model evaluation, and explainable AI (SHAP) for insights.

##  Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations.
- Implementation of multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model performance.
- Explainable AI using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature importance and model interpretability.
- K-Fold Cross-Validation for robust model evaluation.

## Dataset
- The dataset sourced from UCI contains clinical attributes such as:
  - **age**: Patient's age in years.
  - **sex**: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female).
  - **cp**: Chest pain type (e.g., typical angina, non-anginal pain).
  - **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg).
  - **chol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
  - **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved.
  - **num**: Target variable (0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease Present).

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for scripting and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn** for model training and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building a Fully Connected Neural Network.
- **SHAP** for explainability.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data visualization.
